    "## Instantiating an ALE driver\n",
    "\n",
    "ALE drivers are objects that define how to acquire common ISD keys from an input image format, in this case we are reading in a PDS3 image using NAIF SPICE kernels for exterior orientation data. If the driver utilizes NAIF SPICE kernels, it is implemented as a [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers) and will furnish metakernels when entering the context (i.e. when entering the `with` block) and free the metakernels on exit. This maintains the integrity of spicelib's internal data structures. These driver objects are short-lived and are input to a formatter function that consumes the API to create a serializable file format. `ale.formatters` contains available formatter functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default config file is located at `ale/config.yml` and is copied into your home directory at `.ale/config.yml` on first use of the library. The config file can be modified using a text editor. `ale.config` is loaded into memory as a dictionary. It is used to find metakernels for different missions. For example, there is an entry for LRO that points to `/usgs/cpkgs/isis3/data/lro/kernels/mk/` by default. If you want to use your own metakernels, you will need to udpate this path. For example, if the metakernels are located in `/data/lrolrocnac/mk/` the LRO entry should be updated with this path. If you are using the default metakernels, then you do not need to update the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALE has a two step process for writing out an ISD: 1. Instantiate your driver (in this case `LroLrocPds3LabelNaifSpiceDriver`) within a context and 2. pass the driver object into a formatter (in this case, `to_usgscsm`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    " * A PDS3 LRO LROC NAC image\n",
    " * NAIF metakernels installed\n",
    " * Config file path for LRO (ale.config.lro) pointing to LRO NAIF metakernel directory \n",
    " * A conda environment with ALE installed into it usisng the `conda install` command or created using the environment.yml file at the base of ALE."
