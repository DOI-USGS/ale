Version and Date
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Version 3.1 by Boris Semenov, NAIF/JPL, 23 Sep. 2009.

        Added miscellaneous comments. File name and version were not
        changed.

   Version 3.1 by Naru Hirata, Univ. of Aizu, 25 Jul. 2008.

        ***** IMPORTANT *****
        This is a bug-fix release for v 3.0, which include wrong 
        pointing vector angles.
        
        Here is the corrected line.
        TKFRAME_-130102_ANGLES    =  ( -0.087, -0.124, -0.380)
        
        PLEASE REPLACE the older version, v 3.0, with a new one 
        and DISCARD any results that depend on wrong values from 
        the older version.


   Version 3.0 by Naru Hirata, Univ. of Aizu, 10 Apr. 2007.

Implementation Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Applications that need SPICE I-kernel data must ``load'' the
   I-kernel file, normally during program initialization. Loading the
   kernel using the SPICELIB routine FURNSH causes the data items and
   their associated values present in the kernel to become associated
   with a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The application
   program may then obtain the value(s) for any IK data item using the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GIPOOL, GCPOOL. Routine GETFOV may be used
   if the file contains instrument field-of-view (FOV) specification.
   The frame definitions information is accessed via any interfaces
   utilizing SPICE frames subsystem (PXFORM, etc).

   This file was created with, and can be updated with a text editor or
   word processor.


Conventions for Specifying Data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Instrument data items are specified using ``keyword=value''
   assignments. All keywords referencing instrument values in this
   I-kernel start with the characters `INS' followed by the NAIF
   instrument ID code for AMICA, -130102. The remainder of the keyword
   is an underscore character followed by the unique name of the data
   item. For example, AMICA boresight vector is specified by

               INS-130102_BORESIGHT

   The upper bound on the length of all keywords is 32 characters.


Hayabusa Spacecraft Frame Definition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This HAYABUSA_SC_BUS_PRIME frame definition is a copy of the
   definition provided in the main Hayabusa FK file. It is included in
   this IK file for historical reasons.

AMICA Frame Definitions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Two frames are defined for AMICA: HAYABUSA_AMICA_IDEAL and
   HAYABUSA_AMICA. 

   The HAYABUSA_AMICA_IDEAL frame incorporates the ideal fixed
   instrument alignment relative to the spacecraft frame,
   HAYABUSA_SC_BUS_PRIME. The +Z axis of the HAYABUSA_AMICA_IDEAL frame
   is along the ideally-mounted instrument boresight.

   The HAYABUSA_AMICA frame incorporates the the actual instrument
   misalignment relative to its ideal orientation represented by the
   HAYABUSA_AMICA_IDEAL frame. The +Z axis of this frame is along the
   actual instrument boresight.

   Both frames are defined as fixed offset frames with their
   orientation specified using Euler angles.
 
   Note that angles in the frame definitions are specified for "from
   instrument to base (relative to) frame" transformation.

   It is also noted that these instrument frames are different from the
   frame definitions for mechanical design, which are officially referred
   in printed materials. The boresight of the camera points the -Z axis in 
   the coordinates for mechanical design, while it points the +Z axis 
   in the SPICE instrument frame.

AMICA Field-Of-View Definition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The AMICA FOV is defined using a corner-style definition as a 5.83 by
   5.83 degrees square pyramid centered around the boresight that points
   along the +Z axis of the HAYABUSA_AMICA frame. FOV corner directions
   are defined assuming that:
   
    - FOV has square shape with its sides along X and Y axes of the
      instrument's frame;

    - FOV angular size in X direction is 5.83 degrees; in Y direction
      -- 5.83 degrees;

    - boresight vector intersects FOV exactly in the center of the
      rectangle;

   The FOV shape is set to 'POLYGON'; it could also have been set to
   'RECTANGLE'. Corner directions are given counterclockwise as seen
   from boresight.
