Implementation Notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make
   use of this I-kernel must `load' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their
   names in a data structure called the `kernel pool'. The SPICELIB
   routine FURNSH loads a kernel file into the pool as shown below.

      CALL FURNSH ( I_kernel_name )    --FORTRAN
      furnsh_c    ( I_kernel_name );   --C

   In order for a program to extract data from the pool, the SPICELIB 
   routines GDPOOL and GIPOOL are used. See [3] for more details.

   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.


OHRC Camera NAIF IDs
--------------------------------------------------------

   The following NAIF ID is assigned to the camera of OHRC detectors:

      Name                NAIF ID
      ---------------------------
      CH2_OHRC           -152270
      ---------------------------


Keyword Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------

   All names referencing values in this IK file start with the characters `INS' followed by the NAIF Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter spacecraft ID number(-152) followed by a NAIF three digit ID code for instrument. 
   
   The remainder of the keyword name is an underscore character followed by the unique name of the data item. For example, the OHRC PAN boresight direction in the OHRC frame is specified by:

         INS-152270_BORESIGHT

   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32 characters.

   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes any earlier values.


Instrument Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OHRC used to image the moon surface with high spatial resolution. OHRC images used
to characterize the landing site (as its primary goal) with a ground sampling of 0.25-
0.32 m. This data is used to identify and characterize the landing area before the
landing of Lander. OHRC images used to identify the major hazards of importance like
slopes, boulders, craters and shadows. Based on these observations, the landing path
(trajectory) is planned. Currently OHRC is used for imaging scientific regions of interest
(as its secondary goal) and identification and characterization of future landing sites.
This camera is based on reflective system with large aperture of about 300 mm
and 12K TDI detector. The camera generates monochrome images with ground
sampling of 0.25 m from 100 km altitude and swath of about 3 km at nadir. 
With 0.25m GSD from 100km altitude, dwell time is around 160μsec and very low
photon signal has to be detected by OHRC with SNR requirement of greater than 50.
Time Delay Integration (TDI) based imaging sensor has an advantage over external
frame addition technique in terms of read noise components.

>From the 100 km altitude of Chandrayaan-2 S/C, an fov angle of 1.72 deg provides a footprint of 3 km on the lunar surface. (FWHM angle 0.86 deg). 


FOV Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------------

This section defines the FOV. These definitions are based on the OHRC detector parameters provided in a format consistent with/required by the SPICE(CSPICE) function GETFOV (getfov_c). 
Mandatory key words if GETFOV will be used, are, INS-152000_FOV_FRAME, INS-152000_FOV_SHAPE and INS-152000_BORESIGHT.
 
 Here, the X axis of the instrument OHRC PAN is along the boresight. FOV_REF_ANGLE for OHRC PAN is 0 degrees from the X axis. FOV_CROSS_ANGLE is  +/-0.86 degrees.
                                   
                             Y        
                             ^
                             | (X axis is into this plane)

where the FOV_REF_VECTOR keyword specifies a reference
vector that, together with the boresight vector, define the plane in which the half angle given in the FOV_REF_ANGLE keyword is measured. The other half angle given in the FOV_CROSS_ANGLE keyword is measured in the plane normal to this plane and containing the boresight vector
