Messenger/MDIS Instrument Kernel
=============================================================

This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains parameters that
describe the Messenger MDIS narrow angle (NAC) and wide angle (WAC)
camera

Version and Date
-------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0 -- July 31, 2005 -- Kris Becker, U.S. Geological Survey,
    Flagstaff, AZ
    Initial version.

Version 3.0 -- April 24, 2007 -- Kris Becker, U.S. Geological Survey,
    Updated for modifications/refinements to the framing kernel.  These
    changes were introduced in msgr_v070.tf.

Version 4.0 -- December 06, 2007 -- Kris Becker, U.S. Geological Survey,
    Added initial camera distortion parameter for both NAC and WAC as
    well as update the focal lengths.  This model is provided courtesy
    of Scott Turner, JHU, on 2007/12/03.

Version 5.0 -- January 17, 2008 - Kris Becker, U.S. Geological Survey
    Turns out the MDIS WAC has different focal lengths for each
    of the 12 filters.  The distortion model development was done
    using filter 2, the clear filter.  The other filter focal lengths
    are derived from the ratio of the published (SIS) length and
    the new focal lenght of filter 2.

Version 6.0 -- September 30, 2009 -- Kris Becker, U.S. Geological Survey
    Greatly slimmed down version since much of the keywords in previous
    versions has now been incorporated in the newest instrument kernel (IK),
    msgr_mdis_v110.ti.

Version 7.0 -- January 12, 2010 -- Debbie A. Cook, U.S. Geological Survey
    Update to include CK_FRAME_ID and CK_REFERENCE_ID

The following is the definitions for the MDIS Narrow Angle Camera (MDIS-NAC).
Some missions use have time offsets that are needed in order to correct for
timing into the SPICE kernels.  Set the CK time tolerances used when searching
for camera pointing attitude in the CK kernels.

SPK and CK time biases are used in cases where an offset exists in these
kernels in relation to spacecraft clock time.  These times are expressed in
seconds.  The CK_TIME_TOLERANCE is used as a direct argument in the NAIF
routine (ckpg_c) that finds camera pointing.  This is expressed in spacecraft
clock ticks.

\begindata
INS-236820_SPK_TIME_BIAS      = 0.0
INS-236820_CK_TIME_BIAS       = 0.0
INS-236820_CK_TIME_TOLERANCE  = 1

\begintext

The REFERENCE_FRAME and FRAME are used to specify the frames that translate
from spacecraft instrument platform to the instrument orientation.  These
are specific to each mission and are defined in the frame kernel (FK).
For MESSENGER, these are defined in msgr_v???.tf.

\begindata
INS-236820_REFERENCE_FRAME    = 'MSGR_SPACECRAFT'

INS-236820_BORESIGHT_SAMPLE   = 512.5
INS-236820_BORESIGHT_LINE     = 512.5

\begintext
These are the parameters required for writing c-kernels.  Isis will
create ck with the same frame endpoints as the mission ck.  For 
Messenger the ck instrument frame is MSGR_SPACECRAFT (-236000), and the
ck reference frame is J2000 (1).

\begindata
INS-236820_CK_FRAME_ID=-236000
INS-236820_CK_REFERENCE_ID=1

\begintext
This is the description of the Messenger MDIS wide angle camera (MDIS-WAC).
It has twelve filters on a wheel, however, the transforms for pixel/detector
coordinates are independantly defined to simplify maintainance of these
values should the need arise during flight.

\begindata
INS-236800_SPK_TIME_BIAS     = 0.0
INS-236800_CK_TIME_BIAS      = 0
INS-236800_CK_TIME_TOLERANCE = 1

INS-236800_REFERENCE_FRAME    = 'MSGR_SPACECRAFT'

INS-236800_BORESIGHT_SAMPLE   = 512.5
INS-236800_BORESIGHT_LINE     = 512.5

\begintext
These are the parameters required for writing c-kernels.  Isis will
create ck with the same frame endpoints as the mission ck.  For 
Messenger the ck instrument frame is MSGR_SPACECRAFT (-236000), and the
ck reference frame is J2000 (1).

INS-236800_CK_FRAME_ID=-236000
INS-236800_CK_REFERENCE_ID=1

\begintext
OBSERVER/TARGET SWAPPING and STELLAR ABERRATION and LIGHT TIME CORRECTION

These parameters set MESSENGER MDIS WAC/NAC to swap observer/target,
sets light time correction to "LT+S" and disables correction for light time to
surface.

\begindata

INS-236800_SWAP_OBSERVER_TARGET = 'TRUE'
INS-236800_LIGHTTIME_CORRECTION = 'LT+S'
INS-236800_LT_SURFACE_CORRECT = 'FALSE'

INS-236820_SWAP_OBSERVER_TARGET = 'TRUE'
INS-236820_LIGHTTIME_CORRECTION = 'LT+S'
INS-236820_LT_SURFACE_CORRECT = 'FALSE'
