Implementation Notes
--------------------------------------------------------

   Applications that need SPICE I-kernel data must ``load'' the I-kernel
   file, normally during program initialization.

   Loading the kernel using the SPICELIB routine FURNSH causes the data
   items and their associated values present in the kernel to become
   associated with a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The
   application program may then obtain the value(s) for any IK data
   item using the SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GIPOOL, GCPOOL. Routine
   GETFOV may be used if the file contains instrument field-of-view
   (FOV) specification. See [1] for details.

   This file was created with, and can be updated with a text editor or
   word processor.


Conventions for Specifying Data
--------------------------------------------------------

   Data items are specified using ``keyword=value'' assignments [1].
   All keywords referencing values in this I-kernel start with the
   characters `INS' followed by the NAIF MRO instrument ID code,
   constructed using the spacecraft ID number (-74) followed by the
   NAIF three digit ID number for CTX (021). This ID is defined in [3] 
   as follows:

               Instrument name                ID
               --------------------         -------
               MRO_CTX                       -74021

   The remainder of the keyword is an underscore character followed by
   the unique name of the data item. For example, the focal length of
   the CTX is specified by

               INS-74021_FOCAL_LENGTH

   The upper bound on the length of all keywords is 32 characters.

   If a keyword is included in more than one file, or if the same
   keyword appears more than once within a single file, the last
   assignment supersedes any earlier assignments.


Overview
--------------------------------------------------------

   From [5]:

      From its 3 p.m. circular, polar orbit, the MRO Context Camera
      (CTX) will obtain grayscale (black-and-white) images of the
      martian surface with a spatial resolution of about 6 meters (20
      feet) per pixel over a swath that is about 30 kilometers (18.6
      miles) wide. CTX is a Facility Instrument, operated by Malin
      Space Science Systems and the MRO MARCI science team.
 
      As its name implies, CTX will provide context for images acquired
      by other instruments onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter,
      particularly the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment
      (HiRISE) and the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for
      Mars (CRISM).
 
      The instrument consists of a 350 mm focal length, 6 degree field
      of view, catadioptric Cassegrain (Maksutov-type) telescope that
      images onto a 5064 pixels-wide charge coupled device (CDD) line
      array. The CCD detects a broad band of visible light from 500 to
      800 nanometers in wavelength. The instrument includes a 256 MB
      DRAM buffer, so that it can acquire pictures that have downtrack
      lengths greater than 160 kilometers (99 miles). In other words, a
      typical CTX image can be as wide as 30 km and as long as 160 km,
      or more.


Mounting Alignment

   (FK) [3] for the CTX reference frame definitions and mounting
   alignment information.

   This section contains definitions for the CTX FOV. These
   definitions are provided in the format required by the SPICE
   (CSPICE) function GETFOV (getfov_c).
   
   The set of assignments in the data section below defines the
   CTX FOV with respect to the CTX instrument frame to be a rectangles 
   with the corners defined by the first and last pixels of CCD line 
   array and the boresight along the +Z axis. This FOV definition uses
   angular extent style specification with the cross and along track
   angular sizes taken from the ``Optics Parameters'' section above.

``mroctxAddendum001.ti'' Version and Date
-------------------------------------------------------------

   Version 1.0 -- December 12, 2006 -- Elizabeth Miller, USGS, Flagstaff, AZ

      Initial version.


``mroctxAddendum001.ti'' Data
-------------------------------------------------------------

   The following is the focal length, which is expressed in
   MILLIMETERS. This value comes from Randy Kirk's December 7, 2006
   email (HiRISE optical distortion report).

      \begindata

         INS-74021_FOCAL_LENGTH = 352.2483 

      \begintext

   The following is the pixel pitch, which is the distance between
   adjacent pixels on the CCD arrays.  This is expressed in MILLIMETERS
   per pixel.

      \begindata

         INS-74021_PIXEL_PITCH = 7.0E-3

      \begintext

   The following are the optical distortion parameters. These are used
   to transform from observed (distorted) coordinates (unprimed, e.g.,
   x) to ideal coordinates (primed, e.g., xp).  Both sets of
   coordinates are expressed in millimeters.  These are used as
   described in Randy Kirk's December 21, 2004 email (ISIS 3 sensor
   models, take 2).  From Randy's email (assuming x0 and y0 are zero):

      r=sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
      dr = k0*r + k1*r3 + k2*r^5
      rp = r - dr
      xp = x * (rp/r), similarly for yp

   or, rearranging a bit, we have a more efficient version:

      r^2 = x^2 + y^2
      dr/r = k0 + r^2*(k1 + r^2*k2)
      xp = x - (dr/r)*x
      yp = y - (dr/r)*y

   (Randy's original email had a "+" in these last two equations, which
   is incorrect.)
