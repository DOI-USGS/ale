NEAR MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) instrument and frame kernel file
----------------------------------------------------------------

   Version 1.5b by Jeannie Backer, USGS Astrogeology, 01 March 2013.
   
       Altered the NEAR_MSI to NEAR_SC_BUS_PRIME frame rotation to include a 
       second rotation.

   Version 1.5 by Jeff Bytof, NAIF/JPL, 10 March 2000.
   
       Removed tab characters from file.  Corrected comments.  
       

   Version 1.4 by Jeff Bytof, NAIF/JPL, 1 March 2000.
   
       Corrected field of view orientation by swapping Y and Z 
       vector component values in INS-93001_FOV_BOUNDARY_CORNERS.     


   Version 1.3 by Jeff Bytof, NAIF/JPL, 14 August 1998.

  (1) Modified the Euler angles needed to move the NEAR_MSI reference frame 
      into the NEAR_SC_BUS_PRIME frame.  Calibrated boresight data provided
      by Yanping Guo (JHU/APL), dated 13 August 1998, is as follows:

      -----------------------------------------------------
      Instrument  Zenith Angle off   Azimuth Angle off 
                  +Z S/C Axis (deg)  +X' S/C Axis (deg)
                  -----------------  ------------------
         MSI        89.917365          -0.0277221
      -----------------------------------------------------
 
      The zenith angle is measured from the spacecraft +Z axis to the
      instrument boresight, and the azimuth angle is measured
      counterclockwise from the spacecraft +X' axis to the boresight.

      The NEAR_MSI boresight is defined to be identical +X unit vector 
      of its reference frame.

      Using the Euler angles given in this kernel, the components of
      the NEAR_MSI frame relative to the NEAR_SC_BUS_PRIME frame
      are found by the SPICE subroutine SXFORM to be as follows:

      X:      .9999988429    -.0004838414     .0014422523
      Y:      .0004838419     .9999998829     .0000000000
      Z:     -.0014422522     .0000006978     .9999989600
 
      This indicates that the NEAR_MSI boresight points towards
      (.9999988429, -.0004838414, .0014422523) as measured in the
      NEAR_SC_BUS_PRIME frame.

  (2) Corrected the SPICE file ID word to KPL/IK. 


   Version 1.2 (prototype) by JAB, NAIF/JPL, September 11, 1997

      SC_BUS frame definitions were swapped with SC_BUS_PRIME, 
      to follow the NEAR project's use of the code -93000 for the 
      SC_BUS_PRIME frame.        

   Version 1.1 (prototype) by BVS, NAIF/JPL, August 11, 1997
   
      The frame definitions were changed to reflect correct 
      transformation sense specified by FRAMES.REQ document
      released in SPICE toolkit N0047. 
   
   Version 1.0 (prototype) by BVS, NAIF/JPL, April 16, 1997

   Spacecraft frame definitions. Required to support automatic 
   frame transformations. Two frames are defined for NEAR s/c:

      - s/c frame (or s/c technological frame);
      - s/c prime frame; rotated -135 degrees around Z 
        relative to the s/c frame;
      
   Orientation of the first frame is provided in CK files relative 
   to some inertial or non-inertial frame; orientation of the second 
   frame is a constant from the first frame offset specified in 
   the frame definition.
   
   Note that these definitions are duplicated in IK files for all 
   other NEAR instruments.
   
   Note that angles in the frame definitions are specified for "from
   instrument to base (relative to) frame" transformation.

   specification in the header of the GETFOV subroutine. 
   Corner directions are given counterclockwise as seen from 
   boresight.
   
   FOV corner directions are defined assuming that:
   
    - FOV has rectangular shape with its sides along Z and Y 
      axes of the instruments frame;
    - FOV angular size in Y direction is 2.2623 degrees; 
      in Z direction -- 2.9505 degrees;
    - boresight vector intersect FOV exactly in the center of 
      the rectangle;
