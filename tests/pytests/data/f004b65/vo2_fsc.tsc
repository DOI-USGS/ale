Viking Orbiter 2 Reconstructed Frame Start Count (FSC) SCLK file
--------------------------------------------------------

   This file contain data necessary to convert a Viking Orbiter 2
   FSC count to the ET time corresponding to it. These data are
   based on the results of VO2 image times reconstruction done at
   NAIF/JPL. The process of this reconstruction is described in
   detail in the "VO Image Time Reconstruction" document.

   Note that the main purpose of this file is to store the
   reconstructed FSC counter; the on-board clock defined by the
   function in this file was not used to time tag any of the
   orientation data in CK files.

   To avoid confusion with the other VO2 clock used for time tagging,
   the FSC on-board clock in this file was assigned the NAIF ID
   code -30999.
   

Version
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Version 1.0.1 -- April 20, 2000
   
      Comments in the file were slightly reformatted and augmented.
 
   Version 1.0.0 -- July 22, 1996 
     

Implementation notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This SPICE SCLK file is constructed so that valid SCLK strings
   are the eight digit VO2 FSC count associated with each VO2 image.
   Note that the actual "image time" (the time of the beginning,
   middle or the end of exposure) has a significant offset from
   the FSC tick start time. This offset depends on the exposure
   duration and is described in the "VO Image Time Reconstruction"
   document.

   You must load this file into the kernel pool before using any
   of the SPICELIB SCLK routines. The code fragment

      CALL LDPOOL ( < name of this file > )
 
   performs this task. To convert between ET and UTC, you will also
   need to load a leapseconds kernel. The additional call to LDPOOL,

      CALL LDPOOL ( < name of your leapsecond file > )
 
   will accomplish this. Note that you must supply the actual names
   of the files used on your system as arguments to LDPOOL. Because
   the file names are system dependent, we do not list them here.

   For more information, consult your SPICELIB required reading
   files. The following areas are covered:

      SCLK system                     SCLK required reading
      Time systems and conversion     TIME required reading
      Kernel pool                     KERNEL required reading
