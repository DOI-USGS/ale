Viking Orbiter 2 "fictitious" SCLK Kernel
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This file contains the data necessary to convert between the
   'fictitious' Viking Orbiter 2 on-board clock times used as tags
   for pointing instances in Viking Orbiter 2 CK files and ephemeris
   time.

   NAIF suggests that you do not modify this file. If you do modify
   it, be sure to indicate this in the `Version' section below.

 
Version
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Version 1.0.1 -- April 20, 2000
   
      Comments in the file were slightly reformatted and augmented.
 
   Version 1.0.0 -- July 22, 1996
 
 
Implementation notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This SPICE SCLK file is constructed so that valid SCLK strings
   are simply the number of seconds that have passed since the UTC
   epoch 1 Jan 1976 00:00:00. Thus 288929292.827 simply represents
   the epoch that occurs 288929292.827 seconds past the UTC epoch
   1 Jan 1976.

   For all time, the clock runs at the same rate as Terrestrial
   Dynamical Time (TDT). There is only one partition for this clock.

   You must load this file into the kernel pool before using any
   of the SPICELIB SCLK routines. The code fragment

      CALL LDPOOL ( < name of this file > )
 
   performs this task. To convert between ET and UTC, you will also
   need to load a leapseconds kernel. The additional call to LDPOOL,

      CALL LDPOOL ( < name of your leapsecond file > )

   will accomplish this. Note that you must supply the actual names
   of the files used on your system as arguments to LDPOOL. Because
   the file names are system dependent, we do not list them here.

   For more information, consult your SPICELIB required reading
   files. The following areas are covered:

      SCLK system                     SCLK required reading
      Time systems and conversion     TIME required reading
      Kernel pool                     KERNEL required reading
