DSPSE SPICE SCLK Kernel
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This file contains the data necessary to convert between DSPSE
     spacecraft clock time (SCLK) and ephemeris time.
 
     NAIF suggests that you do not modify this file. If you do modify it,
     be sure to indicate this in the `Version' section below.
 
 
Version
--------------------------------------------------------

     This file is DSPSE version 1, released 18-JAN-1994.


Implementation notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     You must load this file into the kernel pool before using any of the
     SPICELIB SCLK routines. The code fragment
 
        CALL LDPOOL ( < name of this file > )
 
     performs this task. To convert between ET and UTC, you will also need
     to load a leapseconds kernel. The additional call to LDPOOL,
 
        CALL LDPOOL ( < name of your leapsecond file > )
 
     will accomplish this. Note that you must supply the actual names of
     the files used on your system as arguments to LDPOOL. Because the file
     names are system dependent, we do not list them here.
 
     For more information, consult your SPICELIB required reading files.
     The following areas are covered:
 
        SCLK system                     SCLK required reading
        Time systems and conversion     TIME required reading
        Kernel pool                     KERNEL required reading
 
 
Kernel data
--------------------------------------------------------

The DSPSE clock zero count occurs at 1-JAN-1950/00:00:00 UTC. Nominally,
the clock will advance at UTC time. When a leapsecond occurs, the clock
will be adjusted accordingly. When this event occurs, a new partition
must be added to this file. To account for leapseconds prior to the
launch of the spacecraft, the begin time below is
1-JAN-1950/00:00:19.000.
