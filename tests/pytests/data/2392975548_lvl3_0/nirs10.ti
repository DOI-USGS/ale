Hayabusa NIRS Instrument and Frame Kernel Kile
===========================================================================

   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains the frames and FOV 
   definitions for Hayabusa Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS).


Version and Date
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Version 1.0 by Boris Semenov, NAIF/JPL 23 Sep. 2009

      Corrected _RELATIVE frame in the _NIRS_IDEAL frame definition
      (HAYABUSA_SC_BUS -> HAYABUSA_SC_BUS_PRIME). Added miscellaneous
      comments. File name and version were not changed.

   Version 1.0 by Shinsuke Abe, Kobe Univ. 9 Sep. 2005

   Version 0.0 (prototype) by Masanao Abe, ISAS/JAXA, 4 June 2005


Implementation Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Applications that need SPICE I-kernel data must ``load'' the
   I-kernel file, normally during program initialization. Loading the
   kernel using the SPICELIB routine FURNSH causes the data items and
   their associated values present in the kernel to become associated
   with a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The application
   program may then obtain the value(s) for any IK data item using the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GIPOOL, GCPOOL. Routine GETFOV may be used
   if the file contains instrument field-of-view (FOV) specification.
   The frame definitions information is accessed via any interfaces
   utilizing SPICE frames subsystem (PXFORM, etc).

   This file was created with, and can be updated with a text editor or
   word processor.


Conventions for Specifying Data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Instrument data items are specified using ``keyword=value''
   assignments. All keywords referencing instrument values in this
   I-kernel start with the characters `INS' followed by the NAIF
   instrument ID code for NIRS, -130200. The remainder of the keyword
   is an underscore character followed by the unique name of the data
   item. For example, NIRS boresight vector is specified by

               INS-130200_BORESIGHT

   The upper bound on the length of all keywords is 32 characters.


Hayabusa Spacecraft Frame Definition

   This HAYABUSA_SC_BUS_PRIME frame definition is a copy of the
   definition provided in the main Hayabusa FK file. It is included in
   this IK file for historical reasons.

NIRS Frame Definitions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Two frames are defined for NIRS: HAYABUSA_NIRS_IDEAL and
   HAYABUSA_NIRS. 

   The HAYABUSA_NIRS_IDEAL frame incorporates the ideal fixed
   instrument alignment relative to the spacecraft frame,
   HAYABUSA_SC_BUS_PRIME. The +Z axis of the HAYABUSA_NIRS_IDEAL frame
   is along the ideally-mounted instrument boresight.

   The HAYABUSA_NIRS frame incorporates the the actual instrument
   misalignment relative to its ideal orientation represented by the
   HAYABUSA_NIRS_IDEAL frame. The +Z axis of this frame is along the
   actual instrument boresight.

   Both frames are defined as fixed offset frames with their
   orientation specified using Euler angles.
 
   Note that angles in the frame definitions are specified for "from
   instrument to base (relative to) frame" transformation.

NIRS Field-Of-View Definition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The NIRS FOV is defined using a corner-style definition as a 0.1 by
   0.1 degree square pyramid centered around the boresight that points
   along the +Z axis of the HAYABUSA_NIRS frame. The FOV shape is set
   to 'POLYGON'; it could also have been set to 'RECTANGLE'.  The
   corner direction vectors are given counterclockwise as seen from
   boresight.
