The focal length was calculated from f# = 1 and aperture = 27.2 mm 
See: http://sbn.psi.edu/pds/asteroid/HAY_A_NIRS_3_NIRSCAL_V1_0/document/nirscalpaper.pdf
The units for focal length are meters and the units for pixel pitch are mm.

  The NIRS orientientiation in ISIS camera model implemenation is
  +Y = +SAMPLE, +X = -LINE, Z = +Z
 
  ITRANSS and ITRANSL were calculated using the camcoeffs application.

NIRS is very close to Itokawa so light time correction 
and target/observer perspective are set as follows.

\begindata 

INS-130200_SWAP_OBSERVER_TARGET = 'TRUE'
INS-130200_LIGHTTIME_CORRECTION = 'NONE'
INS-130200_LT_SURFACE_CORRECT = 'FALSE'
