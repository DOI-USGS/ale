  This kernel is used by the ISIS software to supply required keywords for
  the ISIS camera models. This kernel is furnished to the NAIF SPICE pool as 
  one of the very last kernels. This allows it to overide keywords from other
  kernels.

  History:
  
  2014-05-13 Stuart Sides - Original version. Some information sourced from:
      "JET PROPULSION LABORATORY, INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM 343L-11-002, 8 June 2011"

  2015-05-07 Stuart Sides - Updated LORRI focal length and distortion
      parameters with information from Bill Owen, as per email from Harold 
      Weaver dated 2015-05-06. Some formatting of comments. Added 98302 focal
      length.

  2015-08-27 Stuart Sides - The newest focal length and the distortion model
      coefficients are in the IK as of V200, so removed them from here.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coefficients below are for transforming focal plane X,Y (mm) to/from Line,
Sample. The numbers are from the CCD pixel pitch and the axes diagrams in the 
instrument kernel (nh_lorri_v100.ti).

  +XL ~= -YSC, +XL increasing columns
  +YL ~= -ZSC, +YL increasing rows
  +ZL = borsite , -ZL ~= -XSC, i.e., +ZL is oriented out the back of the 
        instrumnet, going aways from an observed target. 
      
The following TRANS values are for ISIS cubes ingested with no flipping.
First pixel in the input file is line 1 sample 1, second pixel in the input file
is line 1 sample 2.
