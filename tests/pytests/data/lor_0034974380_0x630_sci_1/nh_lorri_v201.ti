LORRI Instrument Kernel
==============================================================================

   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains references to the mounting
   alignment, internal and FOV geometry for the New Horizons LOng Range
   Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI).


Version and Date
----------------------------------------------------------

   The TEXT_KERNEL_ID stores version information of loaded project text
   kernels. Each entry associated with the keyword is a string that consists
   of four parts: the kernel name, version, entry date, and type. For example,
   the LORRI I-kernel might have an entry as follows:

         TEXT_KERNEL_ID += 'NEWHORIZONS_LORRI V2.0.1 01-MAR-2016 IK'

           \begintext

   Version 2.0.1 -- March 1, 2016 -- Howard Taylor, JHU/APL

            --   Added discussion on adapting coefficients of the OOC
                 distortion model (Ky and EM5) to comply with the LORRI
                 instrument frame.
            --   Changed the pixel size to the measured value rather
                 than the assumed value. This affected values for the
                 focal length, f-number, and coefficients in both the
                 OOC and SIP distortion models [15].
            --   Changed the sense of the sign of two coefficients
                 ( Ky, EM5) in the Owen and O'Connell distortion model
                 due to differences in the direction of the +Y-axis used
                 in the published model compared to the LORRI instrument
                 frame.
            --   Fixed values for INS-9830X_OOC_EM_SIGMA.  The exponent
                 had been omitted unintentionally.
            --   Added keywords INS-9830X_APERTURE_DIAM_UNITS
            --   changed the reference for the INS*_OOC_CCD_CENTER keywords
                 from unit reference to zero reference pixel values.
            --   Text updated in Optical Distortion model section that
                 incorrectly described the detector size to include the
                 dark columns.
            --   Removed references to pixel pitch for consistency,
                 replacing with equivalent term:  pixel size.
            --   Clarified representation of mathematical equations
                 in the SIP distortion section.
            --   Added section relating Owen & O'Connell model to the
                 SIP reverse transform.
            --   Updated plate scale (IFOV) values based on updated
                 estimate for focal length.

   Version 2.0.0 -- August 18, 2015 -- Howard Taylor, JHU/APL

            --   Redefined the units of two keywords to maintain
                 internal consistency and to make them consistent with
                 the Owen and O'Connell distortion model.  The units on
                 the FOCAL_LENGTH keyword were changed from m to mm. The
                 units of the APERTURE_DIAMETER keyword were changed
                 from cm to mm.
            --   Added distortion model coefficients for OOC and SIP
                 distortion models.
            --   Fixed begin data and begin text tags in platform id section.

   Version 1.0.0 -- February 21, 2007 -- Lillian Nguyen, JHU/APL

            --   Updated the diagrams to match those in the frames kernel,
                 nh.tf.
            --   Promoting to version 1.0.0 denoting approval of kernel set
                 by instrument teams.

   Version 0.0.3 -- January 4, 2007 -- Lillian Nguyen, JHU/APL

            --   Added field of view information for the 1x1 and 4x4 binning
                 modes.
            --   Added optical and CCD geometry parameters, and reference
                 vector.

   Version 0.0.2 -- October 4, 2006 -- Lillian Nguyen, JHU/APL

            --   Removed the 3-letter frame NH_LOR.

   Version 0.0.1 -- January 25, 2006 -- Lillian Nguyen

            --   Frame definition and frame diagram modified after
                 review by instrument team.

Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------

   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH,
   CSPICE routine furnsh_c, and IDL routine cspice_furnsh load SPICE kernels
   as shown below:

   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)

           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )

   C (CSPICE)

           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )

   ICY (IDL)

           cspice_furnsh, 'kernel_name'

   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GCPOOL, and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.

   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.


Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------

   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF New Horizons spacecraft ID number (-98)
   followed by a NAIF three digit ID code for the LORRI instrument.

   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the LORRI boresight direction in the
   LORRI frame (``NH_LORRI'' -- see [5] ) is specified by:

           INS-98300_BORESIGHT

   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.

   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.


LORRI description
----------------------------------------------------------

   From [4]:

   ``The instrument that provides the highest spatial resolution on New
   Horizons is LORRI - short for Long Range Reconnaissance Imager - which
   consists of a telescope with a 8.2-inch (20.8-centimeter) aperture that
   focuses visible light onto a charge coupled device (CCD). LORRI has a
   very simple design; there are no filters or moving parts. Near the time
   of closest approach, LORRI will take images of Pluto's surface at
   football-field sized resolution, resolving features approximately 100
   yards or 100 meters across.''

   From [1]:

   ``The Long Range Reconnaissance Imager, LORRI, is a modest aperture
   (200 mm), narrow-angle camera capable of producing high-resolution
   imagery.  The LORRI will provide imagery of Pluto-Charon, beginning 90
   days prior to encounter. From 75 days regarding before closest approach,
   LORRI will provide resolution of Pluto beyond that achievable using HST.
     .
     .
     .
   LORRI imager consists of a 208 mm aperture Ritchey-Chretien telescope
   made of silicon carbide.  The telescope is f/12.75, and feeds an
   unfiltered, 1024 x 1024 frame transfer CCD.  The effective band-pass is
   primarily limited by the CCD response to 350 to 850 nm.  There is a long
   composite baffle running the length of the instrument, and smaller
   baffles at the outside of the secondary and inside of the primary.  The
   assembly is mounted to the spacecraft via 3 titanium legs.
     .
     .
     .
   LORRI operations consist of imaging at Jupiter, Pluto/Charon, and one to
   three Kuiper Belt Objects.  Additionally, various calibration images and
   functional tests will be performed.''

   From [3]:

   ``The LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is intended to complement
   the PERSI/MVIC wide angle, medium resolution imagers.  LORRI is
   controlled independently of PERSI/MVIC. It will provide higher resolution
   imagery with a much narrower field-of-view and contributes a measure of
   redundancy to the mission.  Its boresight is aligned to within 0.1 deg of
   PERSI/MVIC to support coordinated operations when operated in their
   "framing mode".  The long-range capability of LORRI will permit the
   receipt of high-resolution observations of Pluto-Charon at least 75 days
   before their encounter and of the Kuiper-Belt Objects (KBOs).
     .
     .
     .
   LORRI is a panchromatic visible imager with an angular resolution of 5
   microrad/pixel and a field-of-view (FOV) of 0.2912 deg x 0.2912 deg.  It
   consists of a 20-cm aperture, f/13 telescope imaging onto a CCD focal
   plane. The combined mass of the telescope structure, mirrors, supporting
   electronics, and aperture door is 8.593 Kg.  To reduce unwanted stray
   light, the telescope is heavily baffled.  LORRI is fixed mounted inside
   the spacecraft structure within a baffle tube protruding through the
   spacecraft structure.  An aperture door provides contamination protection
   during ground operation, launch, and early cruise.''

   The LORRI optics inverts images in both the Y and Z directions, so that the
   projection of these spacecraft axes onto the LORRI CCD will look like the
   following: (Note that we are looking INTO the LORRI telescope in the
   diagram below, whereas above we were looking outwards, hence the position
   of the +Z axis does not appear to have changed when in fact it has flipped).

   Taken from [9], we have the following coordinate system definition for the
   LORRI frame:

   The -Z axis in instrument coordinates is defined to be the boresight and
   is approximately aligned with the spacecraft -X axis. The Y axis in
   instrument coordinates is approximately aligned with the spacecraft -Z axis
   and is in the direction of increasing rows. The X axis in instrument
   coordinates is approximately aligned with the spacecraft -Y axis and is in
   the direction of increasing columns.


LORRI Field of View Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------

   From [10] and updated in [12], the LORRI FOV is 0.29121706 deg square.

   Since LORRI's angular separation in Y is 0.29121706 deg, looking up the +Y
   axis in the instrument frame we have: (Note we are arbitrarily choosing
   vectors that terminate in the Z=-1 plane.)

   Since LORRI's field of view is square, a similar computation yields the
   Y component.

LORRI Optical Distortion Specifications
----------------------------------------------------------

   This section provides parameters for two sets of optical distortion
   models for both formats (1x1 and 4x4) of the LORRI camera.  The first
   model has been used by the New Horizons (NH) Optical Navigation (OPNAV) 
   teams during the NH mission (based on [11] and personal
   communication with Bill Owen; there are two OPNAV teams on NH: 
   "PNAV", led by KinetX, is the "Primary" OPNAV team on NH, and "INAV", 
   led by JPL, is the "Independent" OPNAV team on NH).
   This is the same camera model used by the Deep Impact camera and
   Cassini OPNAV.  The second model is used by the LORRI team and is
   commonly used within the astronomical community (based on [13]).
   The parameters for the SIP model have been derived by Brian
   Carcich using parameters from the Owen & O'Connell model.
   
   
   Owen & O'Connell Distortion Model
   ----------------------------------
   
   The following distortion model has been used by the NH OPNAV team
   for this camera during the mission (based on [11]; according to Bill
   Owen, NH INAV and PNAV used the same camera model as for Deep Impact
   and Cassini OPNAV).
   
   In the following discussion, the terms 'sample' and 'line' are used
   by the author and retained for ease of comparison to the published
   work.  In all cases in this document, sample is equivalent to column
   and line is equivalent to row.

      A 3d vector (P) in the camera frame is mapped into sample and 
      line (S,L) coordinates by:

          ( X )    FL    ( P(1) )
          (   ) = ------ (      )
          ( Y )   P(3)   ( P(2) )
  
              2    2    2
             R  = X  + Y
          
         ( dX )   ( X*R*R  X*Y X*X ) ( EM2 )
         (    ) = (                ) ( EM5 ) 
         ( dY )   ( Y*R*R  Y*Y X*Y ) ( EM6 )

          ( S )   ( Kx   Kxy ) ( X + dX )   ( S0 )
          (   ) = (          ) (        ) + (    )
          ( L )   ( Kyx  Ky  ) ( Y + dY )   ( L0 )

      where FL is the camera focal length in mm; EM(i) are coefficients
      of the cubic radial distortion and detector misalignment; the
      matrix K provides a mapping from millimeters to pixels in the
      focal plane; and (S0,L0) are the focal plane coordinates as sample
      and line of the optical axis.

      The values of X and Y are computed from vector P by way of the
      gnomonic projection.  These values represent the non-distorted
      location in instrument coordinates measured in millimeters.  The
      values for dX and dY indicate the amount of the distortion introduced
      by the optics and electromagnetic configuration of the detector.

      The values of S and L represent the pixel location associated with
      point P as affected by the distortion as would be observed in an
      image.

      The undistorted pixel location associated with X and Y can be
      computed by setting the distortion parameters, EM(i), to 0.

    Adapting Owen and O'Connell Model Parameters To LORRI Instrument Frame
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      The +Y axis defined in OOC model is opposite to the direction of
      the +Y axis defined in the LORRI instrument kernel.  To make use
      of the OOC model equations without modification and remain
      consistent with the LORRI instrument frame, the parameters Ky and
      EM5 must be negated.

      The need to change the sign on Ky is apparent by inspection when
      pushing the four corners of the detector through the OOC model.
      The need to negate EM5 is not as obvious. The derivation below
      supports work by Brian Carcich, who originally identified the need
      to negate EM5, as well as Ky.
      
      Starting from the distortion portion of the OOC model: 

        (  dX  )     (   X*R^2    X*Y   X^2  )    (  EM2 )
        (      )  =  (                       )    (  EM5 )
        (  dY  )     (   Y*R^2    Y^2   X*Y  )    (  EM6 )

      The +Y axis in the OOC model (Y) is opposite the +Y axis in the
      LORRI Instrument frame (Y_L), while the +X axes agree in
      direction. So a change in Y in the OOC model (dY) will be a
      negative change in Y in the LORRI frame (dY_L). 

         Y =  -Y_L
        dY = -dY_L

      Substituting these into the previous equation: 

        (  dX   )     (   X*R^2     -X*Y_L     X^2   )  (  EM2 )
        (       )  =  (                              )  (  EM5 )
        ( -dY_L )     (  -Y_L*R^2   (Y_L)^2   -X*Y_L )  (  EM6 )

      Then rewrite this equation in terms of distortion changes in dX
      and dYL by distributing the negative sign from the left to the
      right side: 

        (  dX  )     (   X*R^2       -X*Y_L      X^2      )  (  EM2 )
        (      )  =  (                                    )  (  EM5 )
        ( dY_L )     ( (-)-Y_L*R^2  (-)(Y_L)^2  (-)-X*Y_L )  (  EM6 )

      And simplifying:

        (  dX  )     (   X*R^2    -X*Y_L        X^2  )  (  EM2 )
        (      )  =  (                               )  (  EM5 )
        ( dY_L )     (  Y_L*R^2   -(Y_L)^2    X*Y_L  )  (  EM6 )

      The structure of this equation is very similar to the OOC model
      but with the Y component of the left-hand matrix negated. By
      absorbing  the negative sign into EM5, the equation will look
      exactly like the OOC model but in terms of the LORRI frame:

        (  dX  )     (   X*R^2      X*Y_L      X^2   )  (  EM2 )
        (      )  =  (                               )  ( -EM5 )
        ( dY_L )     (   Y_L*R^2    (Y_L)^2    X*Y_L )  (  EM6 )

      So by changing the sign on EM5 and Ky, code for the OOC model
      can be reused for to get distortion deltas in the LORRI frame.
      Based on this relationship, the sign of two coefficients (Ky, EM5)
      in this model have been changed from the published material[11] to
      remain consistent with the LORRI instrument frame.

    Initial results (2006)
    ----------------------
      
      The following NH LORRI optical distortion parameters for this
      model were derived using data collected in 2006 and were provided
      by Bill Owen, NH INAV (from [11]) assuming a pixel scale of 13um.

      other parameters computed analytically assuming a pixel scale
      of 13um:

      KMAT(1,1) =  76.9231
      KMAT(1,2) =   0.0
      KMAT(2,1) =   0.0
      KMAT(2,2) =  76.9231   // sign differs from published material **
      S0        = 511.5      // zero reference
      L0        = 511.5      // zero reference

      ** The sign of two coefficients (Ky, EM5) in this model have been
      changed from the published material[11] due to the difference in
      the definition of the LORRI +Y axis for the model compared to the
      LORRI instrument frame. All references to these two coefficients
      in this document have had their sign flipped to remain consistent
      with the LORRI instrument frame.

      The values for S0 and L0 are referenced to the center of the first
      pixel of the first line as 0, rather than 1 as is used in the Owen
      and O'Connell literature. This was done to remain consistent with
      the LORRI coordinate system.

    Updated results (2013)
    ----------------------

      Some of the coefficients for this model were updated [12] using
      the image data from the Wishing Well star cluster collected
      during Annual Check Out 7 (ACO-7), which executed between May and
      August 2013.  These results were derived assuming a pixel size
      of 13um.

    Results used by the LORRI Team in this kernel
    ---------------------------------------------

      After consulting with the CCD manufacturer, E2V Technologies,
      the pixel size was determined to be 12.997 +/- 0.003 um rather
      than the assumed size of 13 um.  To account for the change in
      pixel size, the coefficients published in [12] were scaled
      appropriately [16].  The scale factor is defined as

        T = 12.997 um / 13.000 um

      the scaled coefficients are calculated as:

      scaled Focal Length = original focal length * T
      scaled KMAT(1,1)    = original KMAT[1,1] / T
      scaled KMAT(2,2)    = original KMAT[2,2] / T
      scaled EM2          = original EM2 / T ^ 2
      scaled EM5          = original EM5 / T
      scaled EM6          = original EM6 / T

      The table below captures the scaled coefficients to full precision
      to preserve the relationship to the published values in [12].

   Notice that there are several differences in convention in this
   distortion model when compared to what is adopted in the other 
   portions of this document:
   
      - the keywords in the next section include "_OOC_" for Owen and
        O'Connell to distinguish these distortion parameters from the
        "_SIP_" distortion keywords in the next section.
   
      - the units for INS*_OOC_FOCAL_LENGTH keyword are always
        expressed in millimeters.  The units for focal length were
        previously expressed in meters.  These units have been adjusted
        to millimeters to remain consistent throughout the document.

      - the INS*_OOC_CCD_CENTER keywords listed below follow the LORRI
        pixel naming scheme which labels the center of the first
        pixel of the first row as pixel (0,0). This differs from the
        convention indicated in [11], which labels the center of the
        first pixel of the first row as pixel (1,1).

   The FOCAL_LENGTH keyword is defined below.  It is also presented
   with the _OOC_ term in the keyword to indicate that it is associated
   with the Owen and O'Connell distortion model.  Also note that there
   is no focal length associated with the SIP distortion model.

   The updated values for this data is provided in the keywords below:

   The equivalent coefficients for 4x4 mode can be derived from the 1x1
   mode coefficients.  The only coefficients affected by the effectively
   larger pixel area are given in the last equation from the model:

          ( S )   ( Kx   Kxy ) ( X + dX )   ( S0 )
          (   ) = (          ) (        ) + (    )
          ( L )   ( Kyx  Ky  ) ( Y + dY )   ( L0 )

    The parameters S, L, S0 and L0 are all given in pixel coordinates and
    are thus affected.  Specifically, 4x4 mode has 256 columns and 256
    rows rather than the 1024 columns and 1024 rows for 1x1 mode.
    Because of this, the values for S0 and L0 must be updated to reflect
    the new pixel dimensions.  The parameters in the K matrix also needs
    to be adjusted to account for the effectively larger pixel size
    since they convert from mm to pixel space.

    The 4x4 binning mode combines 4 pixels in each of the X and Y
    directions.  This has the effect of creating a pixel that is four
    times the size in both directions, yielding an effective pixel size
    of 4 * 12.997 um = 51.998 um.  From [11], the Kx and Ky elements of the
    K matrix are computed as the inverse of the pixel size in units of
    mm^{-1}.  The updated values for 4x4 mode are listed in the table below:
    
      KMAT(1,1) =  19.2352138955143523
      KMAT(1,2) =   0.0

      L0        = 127.5                // zero reference

    ** The sign of two coefficients (Ky, EM5) in this model have been

   Simple Imaging Polynomial (SIP) Distortion Model
   ------------------------------------------------
   
   The use of the Simple Imaging Polynomial distortion model is
   prevalent in the astronomy community and is supported by a large
   number of freely available software packages.  It extends the World
   Coordinate System standard for FITS images to provide non-linear
   geometric distortion using polynomials in FITS headers and is
   described in [13]:

        Values u and v are the distorted locations in relative pixel
        coordinates with origin at CRPIX1, CRPIX2, which are the center
        pixel sample and line locations.  Values x and y are
        "intermediate world coordinates" in degrees with origin at
        CRVAL1, CRVAL2, which are Right Ascension and Declination in the
        case of LORRI images. Then f(u,v) and g(u,v) are the quadratic
        and higher order terms of the distortion polynomial:

          ( x ) = ( CD1_1  CD1_2 ) ( u + f(u,v) ) 
          ( y )   ( CD2_1  CD2_2 ) ( v + g(u,v) )
  
        A_p_q an B_p_q are defined as the polynomial coefficients for
        polynomial terms u^p * v^q, respectively.  From this:

                      ----
                      \
            f(u, v) = /    A_p_q * u^p * v^q,   p + q <= A_ORDER
                      ----
                      p,q

                      ----
                      \
            g(u, v) = /    B_p_q * u^p * v^q,   p + q <= B_ORDER
                      ----
                      p,q

        For example, for a third order polynomial:
        f(u,v) = A_2_0 * u^2 + A_0_2 * v^2 + A_1_1 * u * v + 
                 A_2_1 * u^2 * v + A_1_2 * u * v^2 + A_3_0 * u^3 +
                 A_0_3 * v^3

        The values for u and v represent the distorted pixel location
        resulting from the effects caused by the optics, measured
        relative to the center of the detector.

        The CDi_j keywords encode skew as well as rotation and scaling.
        The CD matrix values together with the higher-order distortion
        polynomials define a unique transformation from pixel
        coordinates to the plane-of-projection.

        The polynomials for the reverse transformation are also provided
        for fast inversion.  Pixel coordinates U,V are the location if
        the optics didn't cause any distortion and can be found from:
                    
          ( U ) =     -1  ( x ) 
          ( V )     CD    ( y )

        then the distorted pixel coordinates (u,v) can be computed from
        the undistorted pixel coordinates (U,V) by:

                               ----
                               \
         u = U + F(U,V) = U +  /    AP_p_q * U^p * V^q,  p + q <= AP_ORDER

   Relating the Owen & O'Connell Distortion Model to the SIP Model
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

   With some substitution, the Owen & O'Connell distortion model
   equations can be rewritten in the form of the SIP reverse
   transformation.  To do so requires recognizing that the values of U
   and V in the SIP model represent the undistorted pixel location as
   computed using the gnomonic projection, meaning that the distortion
   produced from the optics are not present.  The SIP values of U and V
   are in units of pixels and can be related to the values X and Y, in
   units of millimeters, from the Owen & O'Connell model by multiplying
   by the effective scale factor

        U = Kx * X              V = Ky * Y
        X = U / Kx              Y = V / Ky

   The following derivation is provided for the sample (ie: column) component
   of the Owen & O'Connell model.  The derivation for the line (ie: row)
   component follows directly.  From the Owen and O'Connell model:

        dX = X * R ^ 2 * EM2 + X * Y * EM5 + X * X * EM6

    Substituting for R ^ 2:

        dX = X * ( X ^ 2 + Y ^ 2 ) * EM2 + X * Y * EM5 + X * X * EM6

    simplifying:

        dX = X ^ 3 * EM2 + X * Y ^ 2 * EM2 + X * Y * EM5 + X * X * EM6

    From the Owen & O'Connell model:

        S = Kx * ( X + dX ) + Kxy ( Y + dY ) + S0

    Rearranging, simplifying and recalling that for LORRI, Kxy = 0:

        S - S0 = Kx * ( X + dX )

    Recall that the S - S0 represents the distorted, relative pixel
    location, which is equivalent to the parameter u in the SIP model.
     
        u = Kx * ( X + X ^ 3 * EM2 + X * Y ^ 2 * EM2 + 
                                     X * Y * EM5 + X * X * EM6 )

    Substituting for X = U / Kx   and  Y = V / Ky

        u = U + EM2 / Kx ^ 2 * U ^ 3 + EM2 / Ky ^ 2 * U * V ^ 2 +
                EM5 / Ky * U * V + EM6 / Kx * U ^ 2

    This equation is now in the form of the SIP reverse transform:

        u = U + F ( U, V )

    The components of F( U, V) are available by inspection:

        AP_3_0 = EM2 / ( Kx ^ 2 )
        AP_1_2 = EM2 / ( Ky ^ 2 )
        AP_1_1 = EM5 / Ky
        AP_2_0 = EM6 / Kx

    Following similar methods, the derivation for the line (ie: row)
    component follows:

        dY = Y * ( X ^ 2 + Y ^ 2 ) * EM2 + Y * Y * EM5 + X * Y * EM6
        dY = X ^ 2 * Y * EM2 + Y ^ 3 * EM2 + Y * Y * EM5 + X * Y * EM6
        L = Kyx * ( X + dX ) + Ky ( Y + dY ) + L0       (recall: Kyx = 0)
        L - L0 = Ky * ( Y + dY )
        v = Ky * ( Y + X ^ 2 * Y * EM2 + Y ^ 3 * EM2 + 
                                     Y * Y * EM5 + X * Y * EM6 )
        v = V + EM2 / Kx ^ 2 * U ^ 2 * V + EM2 / Ky ^ 2 * V ^ 3 +
                EM5 / Ky * V ^ 2 + EM6 / Kx * U * V

    This equation is now in the form of the SIP reverse transform:

        v = V + G ( U, V )

    The components of G( U, V) are available by inspection:

        BP_2_1 = EM2 / ( Kx ^ 2 )
        BP_0_3 = EM2 / ( Ky ^ 2 )
        BP_0_2 = EM5 / Ky
        BP_1_1 = EM6 / Kx
