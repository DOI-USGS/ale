Fictitious SPICE SCLK Kernel for 'Lunar Orbiter 3'
===========================================================================
 
     This file contains the data necessary for converting time
     between ET and ticks of the fictitious on-board clock for
     the 'Lunar Orbiter 3' spacecraft (NAIF ID code -533.)
 
     This fictional clock begins at 1966-JAN-01-00:00:41.182 ET and
     continues for 2147483647 seconds.  The clock has granularity
     of 0.001000-th fraction of a second.
 
 
Production History of this SCLK file
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This file was generated by the NAIF utility program FAKESCLK,
     version 1.0, on 2002-05-12-11:58:03.
 
 
Implementation notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This SCLK file is constructed so that the valid SCLK strings are
     simply the number of TDB seconds that have passed since the
     ephemeris epoch 1966-JAN-01-00:00:41.182.
 
     Thus, 1/288929:820 represents the epoch that occurs 288929 whole
     and 820 0.001000-th of TDB second past 1966-JAN-01-00:00:41.182 ET.
 
     For all time, the clock runs at the same rate as TDB. There is
     only one partition for this clock.
 
     You must load this file into the kernel pool before using any
     of the SPICELIB SCLK routines. The code fragment
 
          CALL FURNSH ( "name of this file" )                (FORTRAN)
          furnsh_c ( "name of this file" );                  (C)
 
     performs this task. To convert between ET and UTC, you will also
     need to load a leapseconds kernel. The additional call to FURNSH,
 
          CALL FURNSH ( "name of your leapseconds file" )    (FORTRAN)
          furnsh_c ( "name of your leapseconds file" );      (C)
 
     will accomplish this. Note that you must supply the actual names
     of the files used on your system as arguments to FURNSH.
