 Focal lengths are in mm and pixel pitch is in mm/pix.  Pixel pitch is
 computed from the scanner setting of 50 microns devided by the Lunar Orbiter
 pixel resolution for all missions of 7.2 (.05/7.2).  The detector map is
 based on the fiducials for the high resolution camera and some of the
 medium resolution camera frames, because the boresight was not
 known. In some medium resolution frames, the boresight can be
 calculated from the "implied" matching high resolution frame.  In
 this case the boresight is read from the instrument labels.  The
 units for CX, CY, and DISTORTION_C3 are 1/mm.
