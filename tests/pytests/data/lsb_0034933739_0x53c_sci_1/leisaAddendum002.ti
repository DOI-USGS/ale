Leisa's pixel pitch is currently set to the size of the pixels (assuming that it is measured in mm,) so assuming no space in-between. 

Leisa's focal length is the same as MVIC's because the light is
focused onto a shared focal plane. This is also in mm.  But there is
some anamorphism, so we are choosing the value that works best for the
scan direction.  It doesn't work as well for the orthogonal axis, but
distortions along that axis are much easier to correct later.

ISIS requires the +Z or -Z axis to be along the boresight of
the telescope. So we rotate the -98201 axes by 90deg about +Y
 
Create a new naif id for the new rotated frame in ISIS:
(Naif Frame ID = -98201 -> Isis Frame ID = -98901)

 The following affine coefficients are useful for band 1 of the ISIS cube. Without
 a constant term in the Y and Line there is no offset in the line direction to 
 correctly transform band 2-256. All lines in band 1 come from line 1 of the 
 256x256 array, all lines of band 2 come from line 2 and so on.

The following affine coefficents are not to be used as is. They are used as the
starting/base values. The constant term is multiplied by the band_number-1 to get the
correct Y and Line constant terms. The other coefficients are used as is for all bands.
