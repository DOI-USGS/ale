RALPH Instrument Kernel
==============================================================================

   This instrument kernel (I-kernel) contains references to the mounting
   alignment, internal and FOV geometry for the New Horizons Visible/IR
   integrated imaging and spectroscopy remote sensing package (RALPH).

Version and Date
----------------------------------------------------------

   The TEXT_KERNEL_ID stores version information of loaded project text
   kernels. Each entry associated with the keyword is a string that consists
   of four parts: the kernel name, version, entry date, and type. For example,
   the RALPH I-kernel might have an entry as follows:

         TEXT_KERNEL_ID += 'NEWHORIZONS_RALPH V1.0.0 22-FEBRUARY-2007 IK'

Implementation Notes
----------------------------------------------------------

   This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make use of
   this instrument kernel must ``load'' the kernel, normally during program
   initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their names
   in a data structure called the ``kernel pool''. The SPICELIB routine FURNSH,
   CSPICE routine furnsh_c, and IDL routine cspice_furnsh load SPICE kernels
   as shown below:

   FORTRAN (SPICELIB)

           CALL FURNSH ( 'kernel_name' )

   C (CSPICE)

           furnsh_c ( "kernel_name" )

   ICY (IDL)

           cspice_furnsh, 'kernel_name'

   In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool, the
   SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GCPOOL, and GIPOOL are used. See [2] for details.

   This file was created and may be updated with a text editor or word
   processor.


Naming Conventions
----------------------------------------------------------

   All names referencing values in this I-kernel start with the characters
   `INS' followed by the NAIF New Horizons spacecraft ID number (-98)
   followed by a NAIF three digit ID code for the RALPH instrument.

   The remainder of the name is an underscore character followed by the unique
   name of the data item. For example, the Ralph boresight direction in the
   Ralph LEISA frame (``NH_RALPH_LEISA'' -- see [5] ) is specified by:

           INS-98201_BORESIGHT

   The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
   characters.

   If the same item is included in more than one file, or if the same item
   appears more than once within a single file, the latest value supersedes
   any earlier values.


RALPH description
----------------------------------------------------------

   From [4]:

   ``Ralph: Visible and infrared imager/spectrometer; provides color,
   composition and thermal maps.
     .
     .
     .
   Ralph's main objectives are to obtain high resolution color maps and
   surface composition maps of the surfaces of Pluto and Charon. The
   instrument has two separate channels: the Multispectral Visible Imaging
   Camera (MVIC) and the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA). A
   single telescope with a 3-inch (6-centimeter) aperture collects and
   focuses the light used in both channels.

   MVIC operates at visible wavelengths - using the same light by which we
   see - and has 4 different filters for producing color maps. One filter is
   tailored to measure the methane frost distribution over the surface, while
   the others are more generic and cover blue, red and near-infrared colors,
   respectively. MVIC also has two panchromatic filters, which pass
   essentially all visible light, for when maximum sensitivity to faint light
   levels is required. In all cases, the light passes from the telescope
   through the filters and is focused onto a charge coupled device (CCD).
   (Although the MVIC CCD is a unique, sophisticated device, virtually all
   consumer digital cameras use CCDs.)

   LEISA operates at infrared wavelengths (it uses heat radiation), and its
   etalon acts like a prism to bend different wavelengths of light by
   different amounts so that each wavelength can be analyzed separately.
   Since quantum physics teaches us that different molecules emit and absorb
   light at different wavelengths, analysis of the different components of
   the light by LEISA can be used to identify the unique "fingerprints" of
   these molecules. LEISA will be used to map the distribution of frosts of
   methane (CH4), molecular nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), and water
   (H2O) over the surface of Pluto and the water frost distribution over the
   surface of Charon. LEISA data may also reveal new constituents on the
   surfaces that have not yet been detected.''

   From [10]:

   ``Ralph is a visible and infrared remote sensing camera comprised of MVIC
   and LEISA. MVIC is the multispectral visible imaging camera. LEISA is the
   infrared spectral imaging focal plane. The Ralph common telescope is based
   on a standard off-axis three mirror anastigmat design, which directs the
   image to a beamsplitter, sending the image to both the MVIC detector and
   LEISA.
   .
   .
   .
   The Ralph telescope is an all aluminum three-mirror "anastigmat"
   telescope.  It has a 75 mm aperture and a 650 mm effective focal length
   when at its operating temperature of 220 K, or -53 degrees C.  Its large,
   flat focal plane is shared by a beamsplitter that transmits the infrared
   light to the LEISA detector, while reflecting the visible and near-IR
   light to the MVIC detector.  The field of view is 5.7 by 0.9 degrees for
   the visible, and 0.91 degrees square for the IR.  The mirrors are to be
   made of aluminum, diamond turned, with uncoated aluminum surfaces.''

   From [9]:

   ``MVIC shall provide imaging science data in five spectral bands at visible
   and near-infrared wavelengths. MVIC shall also provide Optical Navigation
   (OPNAV) imaging data for spacecraft navigation and orientation. The LEISA
   instrument shall provide high spectral resolution imaging science data at
   short-wave infrared wavelengths. MVIC will use optical filters to provide
   spectral band discrimination. LEISA will use a linear variable etalon
   filter to provide spectral discrimination. MVIC and the LEISA instrument
   shall use a common light collection telescope. The common telescope shall
   use a beamsplitter to direct light into two individual optical paths for
   the MVIC and LEISA detectors. MVIC shall obtain two dimensional science
   imaging data using time-delayed integration (TDI) data acquisition
   synchronized to one dimensional spacecraft rotation. MVIC will also obtain
   science imaging data using frame transfer data acquisition. The LEISA
   instrument shall obtain two-dimensional imaging data in push broom mode.
   MVIC shall use optical filters to provide the spectral band discrimination.
   MVIC shall have five spectral bands, for data obtained using TDI data
   acquisition, with wavelength ranges as described in Table 1 [reproduced
   below].

   MVIC shall have a FOV that is determined by the TDI data acquisition range
   in the in-track direction.
   MVIC will have a FOV of 5.7 deg. x 0.15 deg.for images obtained using frame
   transfer.
   MVIC will use a front-side illuminated CCD silicon detector array.

   Definitions/Glossary of Terms
   -----------------------------
   Cross-Track Direction - In spacecraft coordinates, motion that includes a
   component in the +Z or -Z directions where the Z-axis is the axis of
   rotation for the spacecraft in scan mode.
   In-Track Direction - In spacecraft coordinates, motion in the X-Y plane
   associated with spacecraft rotation about the Z-axis.
   Instantaneous Field of View - The field of view imaged by the full detector
   array with the spacecraft in staring mode.
   OpNav Imaging Mode - For the MVIC sensor, this mode is used to take data to
   meet OpNav requirements. 2D imaging for OpNav imaging mode is acquired
   through frame transfer with the spacecraft in staring mode.
   Scan Mode - In spacecraft coordinates, spacecraft rotation about the
   Z-axis. Scan mode is used to acquire data for 2D images through
   synchronized physical scanning and detector array readout. In scan mode,
   the field of view in the in-track direction is determined by the length of
   observation, IFOV, and the scan rate.
   Science Imaging Mode - For the MVIC sensor, this mode is used to take data
   to meet science requirements. 2D imaging for science imaging mode is
   acquired through synchronized operation with 1D spacecraft maneuvers. The
   detector readout occurs in TDI mode.
   Single Pixel Instantaneous Field of View - The field of view for a single
   pixel in a detector array.
   Staring Mode - The spacecraft is pointed at a specific point and does not
   have rotation about the Z-axis of the spacecraft. Staring mode is used to
   acquire data for 2D images through frame transfer techniques for 2D
   detector arrays.
   TDI Mode Data Acquisition - For TDI data acquisition, a 2D image is
   obtained by scanning around the Z axis. Looking down on the spacecraft from
   above the ecliptic, in the nominal flight configuration (+Z pointing up,
   -X pointing at Pluto or Charon), the spacecraft scans from left to right
   clockwise.
   TDI FOV - This indicates that the field of view for an image is variable
   because it is related to spacecraft motion. Roughly, TDI FOV is the total
   angle scanned by the spacecraft for a single observation. The TDI FOV is
   comprised of multiples of the single pixel instantaneous field of view. For
   a single observation by the FOV in the cross track direction.
   LEISA Data Acquisition - For LEISA data acquisition, a 2D spectral image
   is obtained by scanning around the Z axis in either the clockwise or
   counterclockwise direction.''

 RALPH Field of View Parameters
----------------------------------------------------------

   The detectors that constitute Ralph are MVIC, LEISA, and SIA. MVIC
   has several focal plane arrays.

            --   Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC)

                 --   MVIC Frame Transfer Array (FT)

                 --   MVIC Pan 1 Array (PAN1)

                 --   MVIC Pan 2 Array (PAN2)

                 --   MVIC Red Array (RED)

                 --   MVIC Blue Transfer Array (BLUE)

                 --   MVIC Methane Array (METHANE)

                 --   MVIC NIR Array (NIR)

            --   Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA)

            --   Solar Illumination Aperture (SIA)

   The field of view sizes for the above detectors/arrays are given in [11],
   with the exception of the PAN1, PAN2, RED, BLUE, METHANE, and NIR vertical
   (along-scan) directions. Each of those arrays has 32 pixels per row [11].
   The fields of view for those arrays were calculated using the following
   formula:

      along-scan FOV size = ( rows * IFOV ) deg

                          = ( 32 * 19.8/1000000 rad ) * ( 180/pi ) deg

                          = 0.036 deg

   The cross-scan FOV size is 5.67 deg for each of the MVIC arrays [11].

   The field of view sizes are given in the tables below.

   boresight (spacecraft Y axis) [8]. The ALICE SOC FOV is illustrated in [8].

   The MVIC and LEISA boresights are nominally aligned to the spacecraft -X
   axis.

   The INS[ID]_FOV_FRAME, INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE, INS[ID]_BORESIGHT, and FOV
   ANGLES specification keywords defined below are used to describe the
   instrument field of view. Since the SIA detector has a circular field
   of view, and the MVIC arrays and LEISA have rectangular ones, the
   INS[ID]_FOV_SHAPE will either be 'CIRCLE' or 'RECTANGLE'. For SIA, GETFOV
   returns a single vector that lies along the edge of the circular cone, and
   for the MVIC arrays and LEISA, GETFOV returns four boundary corner vectors.

   Note that a field of view is not defined for the instrument boresight. The
   SPICE routine GDPOOL may be used to get the NH_RALPH boresight.


Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) FOV Definitions

   There is no single field of view definition for the Ralph instrument [13],
   but the instrument boresight is by definition the center of the frame
   transfer array. That boresight is the -X axis of the NH_RALPH frame:

   N.B. This incomplete FOV frame has been disabled to satisfy a lien from
        the PDS review of Release 0002 of this data set in August, 2014.

   Each of the MVIC arrays, LEISA, and SIA have a field of view defined. Those
   definitions are below.

   Since the MVIC frame transfer array's angular separation in Y is 0.145
   degrees, looking down the Z axis in the instrument frame we have: (Note
