Asteroid Ceres SPICE PCK file, DAWN SPG 2016-01-07 Solution
===========================================================================


Pedigree and Intended Usage
--------------------------------------------------------

     This PCK file contains Ceres rotation values that were determined
     during the stereo photogrammetric analysis of Dawn images during
     the creation of the HAMO DTM (see [1]). Users of this DTM should
     also use this planetary constants kernel for SPICE based image
     processing.

Orientation constants for asteroid Ceres
--------------------------------------------------------

     The inertial reference frame for Ceres constants is J2000; this is
     the default reference frame for PCK orientation data.

     The epoch of the constants is J2000; this is Julian ephemeris date
     (JED) 2451545.0.

     The NAIF integer code for Ceres is 2000001. See the NAIF_IDs
     required reading for further information on NAIF integer codes.

     The Ceres rotation constants provided below are from [1].
