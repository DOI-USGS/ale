 
TEST SPICE SCLK Kernel
--------------------------------------------------------
 
This file contains the data necessary for converting from ET to
ticks for the fictional spacecraft clock having id code 915.  It is
produced by the utility program prediCkt.
 
This SCLK kernel is intended to be used with the test CK file with
structure IDs listed below on board the spacecraft -915.
 
This fictional clock begins at 1971-JUL-29-03:23:54.861 ET and continues
for 1 billion seconds.  The clock has a granularity of 0.1
milliseconds.
 
This is intended for study purposes or for those situations in
which a clock is not available for the structure whose orientation
will be modelled by a C-kernel.
 
If you have any questions about this file that these comments don't
answer, contact Bill Taber at NAIF.

Implementation notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
This SCLK file is constructed so that the valid SCLK strings
are simply the number of TDB seconds that have passed
since the Ephemeris epoch 1971-JUL-29-03:23:54.861.
Thus 1/ 288929292.8201  simply represents the epoch that occurs
288929292.8201 TDB seconds past the ET epoch 1971-JUL-29-03:23:54.861.
 
 
For all time, the clock runs at the same rate as TDB. There is only
one partition for this clock.
 
You must load this file into the kernel pool before using any of the
SPICELIB SCLK routines. The code fragment
 
CALL LDPOOL ( < name of this file > )
 
performs this task. To convert between ET and UTC, you will also need
to load a leapseconds kernel. The additional call to LDPOOL,
 
CALL LDPOOL ( < name of your leapsecond file > )
 
will accomplish this. Note that you must supply the actual names of
the files used on your system as arguments to LDPOOL. Because the file
names are system dependent, we do not list them here.
 
For more information, consult your SPICELIB required reading files.
The following areas are covered:
 
SCLK system                     SCLK required reading
Time systems and conversion     TIME required reading
Kernel pool                     KERNEL required reading
